% Input R (structure with field obtained from slice_io.m
%   R.spikes = raw traces of the spikes

%   R..mp = various membrane parameters
% Output:
%   F = cell array of features
%   S = cell array of spikes
%   SR = cell array of sampling rates - (needed to reconstruct the time
%       series
